 <h2>Task Details:</h2> 
<p>1. Create a table . 
2. When a user clicks on the edit button under the action column, it will trigger an inline-edit dialog box, this will only rename the task name and nothing else. 
3. When a user clicks on Add Data button, it will trigger a side panel (Drawer), where user can input task name, end date, description, assign tasks, and followers. Start Date will be current date. 
4. I have mentioned the type of input it will accept in placeholders.
